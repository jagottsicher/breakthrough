# breakthrough
## An extension for your (mostly) POSIX-compliant shell based on ncurses putting a TUI as a quasi-windows-like layer over the terminal.

A pseudo-windows-like interface for (mostly) POSIX-compliant operating systems written in C (maybe some C++).

This is a first draft only - urgently seeking companions. Please read the first draft of the [whitepaper](https://github.com/jagottsicher/breakthrough/blob/main/docs/whitepaper.md) and, if you're interested, open an issue or [start a discussion](https://github.com/jagottsicher/breakthrough/discussions). 

Surely, there is a spot for you if you want to commit. There is no need to fork from, em, barely nothing. Thanks!

P.S.: Please note the sponsor button above. You can send me a few Satoshis with the Lighning Network ⚡️ – it already works!
